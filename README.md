Repository for my DPhil (PhD) in Engineering Science thesis at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/)

My research focused on the application of novel Bayesian and online learning methods to portfolio optimisation.

My supervisors were Professors [Stephen J Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and [Michael A Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/).
