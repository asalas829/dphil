%% OXFORD THESIS TEMPLATE

% Use this template to produce a standard thesis that meets the Oxford University requirements for DPhil submission

% Originally by Keith A. Gillow (gillow@maths.ox.ac.uk), 1997

% I've (John) tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the various options.  Remember
% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{ociamthesis}



%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% Three options going on here; use in any combination.  But remember to turn the first two off before
% generating a PDF to send to the printer!

% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)
%\fancyfoot[C]{\emph{DRAFT Printed on \today}}

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
%\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
\usepackage[square]{natbib}
\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
\renewcommand{\bibsection}{\subsubsection*{\bibname}}
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\small}

% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):
%\numberwithin{equation}{subsection}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}



%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.
\begin{abstractseparate}
	\input{text/abstract} % Create an abstract.tex file in the 'text' folder for your abstract.
\end{abstractseparate}


% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
\begin{dedication}
	\it{To Vicky, Johann, Jessi and Edith.}
\end{dedication}

% %%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{acknowledgements}
	\input{text/acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
%\begin{abstract}
%	\include{text/abstract}
%\end{abstract}

%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
\flushbottom

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents

% \listoffigures
% 	\mtcaddchapter
% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity to avoid confusing minitoc

% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
%\listoftables
%	\mtcaddchapter

%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.
%\include{text/abbreviations}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}

%%%%% CHAPTERS
% Add or remove any chapters you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom
