	abstract = {{A recently proposed Bayesian approach to online learning is applied to
learning a rule defined as a noisy single layer perceptron. In the
Bayesian online approach, the exact posterior distribution is
approximated by a simple parametric posterior that is updated online as
new examples are incorporated to the dataset. In the case of binary
weights, the approximate posterior is chosen to be a biased binary
distribution. The resulting online algorithm is shown to outperform
several other online approaches to this problem.

  abstract = 	 {This paper describes a new online convex optimization method which incorporates a family of candidate dynamical models and establishes novel tracking regret bounds that scale with comparator’s deviation from the best dynamical model in this family. Previous online optimization methods are designed to have a total accumulated loss comparable to that of the best comparator sequence, and existing tracking or shifting regret bounds scale with the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many practical scenarios, however, the environment is nonstationary and comparator sequences with small variation are quite weak, resulting in large losses. The proposed dynamic mirror descent method, in contrast, can yield low regret relative to highly variable comparator sequences by both tracking the best dynamical model and forming predictions based on that model. This concept is demonstrated empirically in the context of sequential compressive observations of a dynamic scene and tracking a dynamic social network.}
